			In 2014 I decided to go back to college as a mature student. I completed the UCD Access to Science &amp; Engineering course and in 2015 was enrolled in UCD's Engineering course. In 2nd year I focused on electronic engineering and it was at this point that I was exposed to computer science related subjects for the first time. Throughout my degree there were a number of computer science modules on offer, such as Computer Science for Engineers and Network &amp; Internet Systems, and these were often the ones I enjoyed the most. With some of the early programming modules, I appreciated the logical process required to write code that would satisfy the problems at hand. However, these classes were more concerned with learning specific languages, beginning with C, then C++ and then on to Java. It wasn't until my final year that we were given a glimpse into some of the concepts of software development that go beyond just programming; concepts such as version control, UML diagrams, unit testing etc.

			As a long time user of computers I have seen the complexity of web design increase over the years, from the more simple layout of the websites of the 1990s, designed in mind for lower screen resolutions, to more modern websites with features such as hamburger menus and embedded videos. I am also interested in the balance between the development of websites that are aesthetically pleasing while also being sufficiently functional. Also with the increase in use of portable electronic devices there is the added requirement to have websites function correctly through different methods of interaction, for example, a website functioning correctly whether being accessed through a browser running on Android versus running on Windows.

			I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to upskill and further increase my knowledge within areas of computer science I had been introduced to within my degree, as well as be introduced to more specific areas of web development, something I wasnâ€™t afforded the opportunity of as part of my Electronic Engineering degree.
